Here are ten question statements for Java practice programs involving operators and the Scanner class:

Write a program to calculate the sum of two numbers entered by the user.
Write a program to calculate the average of three numbers entered by the user.
Write a program to convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula (Celsius * 9/5) + 32.
Write a program to check whether a given number is even or odd.
Write a program to find the maximum of two numbers entered by the user.
Write a program to swap the values of two variables without using a third variable.
Write a program to calculate the area of a triangle given its base and height.
Write a program to check whether a given year is a leap year or not.
Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number entered by the user.
Write a program to check whether a given character is a vowel or a consonant.
These question statements can be used as a starting point to implement the corresponding Java programs involving operators and the Scanner class.
